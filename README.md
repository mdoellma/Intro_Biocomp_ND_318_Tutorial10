Trying additional parameters: 
Increasing beta and keeping gamma the same results in greater infected individuals within the population. 
The %affected is calculated at 100%. The greater the number of interactions the greater liklihood of 
individuals becoming infected. 

Increasing gamma and keeping beta the same resulted in fewer infected individuals. 
The %affected was 0.11%. 

This makes sense as the basic reproduction unit is beta(S+I+R) / gamma 

In general:
The rate that people are infected is related and proportional to the number of people who are infected. This is also true for the number of people who are susceptible.
As infected people increases, the likelihood that a susceptible person becomes infected increases.

As beta increases, people are moving more quickly from infected to resistant
