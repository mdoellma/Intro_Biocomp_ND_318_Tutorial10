Effects of B, r, and R0 on a disease transmission model:
Generally, as B and r decrease, max incidence and max prevalence 
decrease slightly. R0 increases when B increases or r decreases. When 
looking at the graphs of susceptible, resistant, and infected 
individuals over time, susceptibility will drop to zero given enough 
time. This time shortens as B and r increases. When B and r are very 
small, the infected curve increases exponentially, reaching its peak, 
and then decreases linearly. Conversely, the resistant curve increases 
very little at first, but it rises linearly as infected cases decrease 
linearly. It seems that if the ratio of B to r decreases, the time for 
infected cases to skyrocket increases. On the other hand, if this ratio 
is large, infection almost immediately reaches max.
