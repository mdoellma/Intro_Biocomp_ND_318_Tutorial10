Trying additional parameters: 
Increasing beta and keeping gamma the same results in greater infected individuals within the population. 
The %affected is calculated at 100%. The greater the number of interactions the greater liklihood of 
individuals becoming infected. 

Increasing gamma and keeping beta the same resulted in fewer infected individuals. 
The %affected was 0.11%. 

This makes sense as the basic reproduction unit is beta(S+I+R) / gamma
