Percent affected, prevelance, and reproduction are all minimized
when beta is small and gamma is large. Incidence, however, becomes negative
before this point. Changes in gamma have a larger effect on all four
parameters than changes in beta. The basic reproduction number is simply
beta divided by gamma. These results are logical because beta represents
the contact rate, and gamma represents the rate of transition (meaning either
recovery form the disease or death, but either way the individual is
eliminated from the pool of infedcted.) The highest contact rate (beta)
combined with the lowest trnsition rate would naturally result in the most
number of individuals infected.
