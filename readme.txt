The first set of graphs let us see how carrying 
capacity, growth rate, and initial population sizes affected a 
population. The first graph 
shows that if growth rate is negative you converge on zero. If growth 
rate is positive you converge on the carrying capacity. As growth rate 
increases you approach carrying capacity more rapidly. The second graph 
shows that when you have different carrying capacities for different  
populations they each reach their own respective carrying capacities. 
The Third plot shows that your population always reaches the carrying capacity 
despite where you started (e.g. higher you go down, lower you go up.)

The second set of graphs in the SIR model show how dynamics of susceptible, 
infected, and recovered populations differ between values of beta (infection 
rate) and gamma (recovery rate). When gamma is large small, the disease goes 
extinct very fast and the whole population is recovered. When gamma is 
smaller compared to the beta, the disease persists longer but eventually 
goes extinct. The population reaches an equilibrium between those that are 
still susceptible and those that have recovered.
