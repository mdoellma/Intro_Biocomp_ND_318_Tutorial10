#The larger the value of beta, the greater the rate of change of S is observed. 
#However, the smaller the value of gamma, the greater the rate of S is observed.
#Taken together, the values of beta and gamma are inversely correlated in regards to S.

#The smaller the vlaue of beta, the greater the rate of change of I is observed.
#The smaller the value of gamma, the greater the rate of change of I is observed.
#Taken together, the values of beta and gamma are directly related in regards to I.

#The larger the value of beta, the greater the rate of change of R is observed.
#The largerthe value of gamma, the greater the rate of change of R is observed.
#Taken together, the values of beta and gamma are directly related in regards to R.

#R0 = beta/gamma.
#For basic reproduction number depends on the ratio/equilibrium between beta and gamma.
