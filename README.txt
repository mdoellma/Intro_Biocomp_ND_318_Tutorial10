Exercise10_Final has the code for parts 1 and 2
Exercise10_Additional_Parameters_Part2 has other parameter values for 
beta to look at differences in prevalance, R0, etc.

With the initial beta and gamma values given, generally the higher beta 
values result in increased max prevalance, percent affected, and an R0 
above 1 indicating the disease is still spreading. The condition with 
the lowest incidence, prevalance, percent affected, and R0 below 1 
(indicating disease epidemic is dying out) is the condition with the 
lowest beta value, and the second highest gamma value. In conditions 
that have equal beta values, the condition with the lower gamma value 
increased values across the board. In conditions with the same gamma, a 
decrease in beta lowered the values of the results.
Changing all of the beta to higher values (0.05 or greater) increased 
max prevalance in all conditions except that in which gamma and beta 
both equaled 0.50. Percent affected was increased to 100%, and R0 is 
1000.
